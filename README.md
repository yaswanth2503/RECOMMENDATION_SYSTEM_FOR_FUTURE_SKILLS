RECOMMENDATION_SYSTEM_FOR_FUTURE_SKILLS
This project aims to build a recommendation system that suggests skills for individuals to acquire, based on current trends, personal interests, and future job market predictions. Using a combination of data analysis, machine learning, and trend forecasting, the system can help users identify skills that are likely to be in demand, allowing them to stay competitive in their respective fields.

Features
Personalized Skill Recommendations: Based on user profiles, interests, and career goals.
Market Trend Analysis: Analyzes job market trends and industry reports to predict future skill demands.
Learning Pathways: Suggests learning resources, courses, and pathways to acquire recommended skills.
User Feedback Loop: Incorporates feedback to refine recommendations over time.
Visualizations: Displays data insights, trends, and user progress with interactive visualizations.

Technologies Used
Python for data processing and model building
Machine Learning (scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch) for recommendations and trend forecasting
Data Analysis (Pandas, NumPy) for trend identification
Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly) for insights and progress tracking
Web Framework (Flask/Django) for front-end integration
Database (PostgreSQL/MySQL) to store user profiles and skill data
